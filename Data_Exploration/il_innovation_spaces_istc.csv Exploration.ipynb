      "<p>NCAUR invents new industrial and food products from agricultural commodities, develops new technologies to improve environmental quality, and provides technical support to Federal regulatory and action agencies. As the designated lead technology transfer facility for USDA, NCAUR maintains a mixed portfolio of interdisciplinary science ranging from fundamental to applied research. Microorganisms and/or their enzymes are being developed to transform raw agricultural materials (starch, proteins, oils) to commercially valuable products such as food additives, fuels, cosmetics, and industrial lubricants. Processing technologies that include extrusion, jet cooking, high pressure reactions, and supercritical extraction are being used to make new value-added products such as biodegradable plastics, edible films, printing inks, novel flavors, and pigments. Modern biotechnology tools are being used to produce new products for many industrial uses, improved food quality, and better human nutrition. The techniques are also being used to control agricultural pests (microorganisms, weeds, insects) that decrease crop yields, pose health hazards, and limit exports for American crops in world trade. NCAUR scientists work collaboratively with universities, private industries and other government agencies to develop new technologies. The capacity to collaborate has been strategically and significantly expanded to accelerate technology transfer. The Pilot Plant is a modular facility for chemical, biological and food processing, located in the newly renovated north wing. It encompasses over 65,000 sq. ft. with four two-story laboratory bays for scale-up research and concept demonstration. Support laboratories for materials testing, evaluation and preparation are also available, along with access to in-house expertise. This design provides a product development and production area within NCAUR capable of functioning as a business incubator and providing added value to private sector collaborations.</p>    2\n",

      "Microphysics Laboratory Facility Information, Equipment and Other Resources:\\r\\r1) II-VI growth and in situ characterization facilities \\r\\rThe MPL at the UIC maintains four RIBER MBE growth systems; a 3-inch Riber 32P MBE system, two Riber 2300 system, and a 5-inch Riber Opus system. These four machines offer great flexibility in the range of materials grown and in the in situ characterization techniques available to the grower. The Riber 32P MBE system is configured for the growth of HgCdTe layers and superlattices. This chamber is equipped with a valved Hg cell and an indium cell for n-type doping. It is also equipped with a state-of-the-art Woollam M2000 Spectroscopic Ellipsometer capable of in situ measurement of the dielectric function of the growing surface in the spectral range of 0.7 to 5.0 eV. Two Riber 2300 systems are configurable for the growth of various materials including wide band II-VI and thin magnetic layers. Finally, the Riber Opus system is primarily configured for the growth of CdTe on large (up to 5 inch) Si substrates. The in situ characterization techniques attached to the four growth chambers include RHEED, spectroscopic ellipsometry, XPS and AES. A clean room which is constructed following the Federal Standard 209e Class 10K, contains all MBE chambers as well as three complete chemical hoods for sample preparation. In addition, MPL also has a RF magnetron sputtering system, several thermal evaporation systems, as well as sol-gel and chemical deposition facilities for poly-crystalline or nano-scale crystalline film deposition or growth.  \\r\\r\\r\\r2) Ex situ characterization facilities \\r\\rElectrical characterization facilities in MPL include Hall effect and other current-voltage measurement equipment (fully automated from 300 K down to 8 K). This equipment can be upgraded in order to perform photonic-electrical-magnetic measurements to determine carrier diffusion lengths and recombination lifetimes. It can also perform I-V device characterization measurements from 8 K to room temperature. \\r\\r\\r\\rBruker D8 Discover High resolution X-ray diffraction System with Ge 4-bounce monochrometer and Ge 3-bounce path finder to measure crystal rocking curve (RC) FWHM�۪s of the epitaxial layers. It was supported by ARO though its 2008 DURIP program.\\r\\r\\r\\rResearch class step scan Nicolet 870 FTIR spectrometer operable at wave lengths between 500 nm in the visible to 200 �m in the VLWIR with variable temperature capability from 1.9 to 300 K. The instrument is capable of performing double modulation spectroscopic measurements of spectral response and relative quantum efficiency of devices. This instrument can measure transmission, reflection and the spectral response of photocurrent at the same position on the sample.  \\r\\r\\r\\rIn addition, MPL ex-situ characterization lab includes:\\r\\r��_ Infrared microscope mapping to analyze composition and thickness uniformities with a lateral resolution of 1 �m/step and a focus with a diameter of 20 �m.\\r\\r��_ I-V and C-V device characterization equipment operable in the range of 77-300 K.\\r\\r��_ Temperature-dependant photoconductive decay lifetime equipment capable of operating in the range 77-300 K.\\r\\r��_ M2000 Spectroscopic ellipsometry equipment\\r\\r��_ Scanning probe microscope that can measure AFM under both contact and tapping mode for the samples with ��_ 4 inch diameters.\\r\\r��_ Device detectivity measurements.  \\r\\r\\r\\r3) Device fabrication facilities \\r\\rThe device fabrication clean-room laboratory, which was assembled in September, 2004, houses a variety of instruments that users can use for photolithography, fabrication, metal-bump hybridization and back-end.\\r\\r\\r\\rThe lithography capabilities include a Karl Suss MJB3 mask aligner for 'top to bottom' alignment of masks to wafers. It can accommodate samples ranging in size from a few millimeters to two inches (5.08 cm). The system can deliver accuracy up to 0.8 um. The alignment module is capable of handling proximity, soft contact and high precision (vacuum) printing requirements. \\r\\r\\r\\rThe thin film deposition capabilities consist of four thermal evaporation chambers for ZnS, CdTe, wax and thick In-bump metal and a 4 pockets e-beam metal deposition system for Au, Ni, Cu and Ti, which allows depositing of metal films for contacts or depositing insulating films of CdS.
