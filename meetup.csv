In fact, the Silicon Valley Data Science headquarters are located next to the Bay Areaâ€™s commuter line â€“ a constant and disruptive reminder of our daily frustrations with the train.</p> <p>We put our frustration into action by taking advantage of our location and integrating other publically available sources to create an event detection system that monitors the health of the train network in real-time. In order to gain understanding of a physical system we could only observe in limited ways, we created a variety of data streams including video and audio that detect the sound and image of trains as they pass by.</p> <p>In this informative talk we will give a brief overview of the techniques we used for audio and video detection. We will then describe how we went about combining our physical observations both with each other and with external data sources such as Twitter and public APIs. By taking into account the different properties of each data source, we will show how to arrive at a prediction more accurate, and more robust, than any one of its parts.</p> <p>We will conclude by discussing how event detection techniques are useful in other business settings such as industrial engineering and public health to make more informed decisions about the environment.</p> <p>John Akred is the Chief Technology Officer of Silicon Valley Data Science, and has over 15 years of experience in advanced analytical solutions and analytical system architectures.

If following Wheatonâ€™s Law doesnâ€™t appeal to you, as a wise old Jedi once said, â€œThese arenâ€™t the droids youâ€™re looking for.â€ù</p> <p>The Chicago Nerd Social Club hosts a number of nerd-friendly events. Some are purely social: casual get-togethers at a bar, trips to the movies, gaming nights. Others are informational in nature: local museum outings, introductions to new technologies, and comic book swap nights. Most events are free or as inexpensive as we can make them. So join us at our next event!</p> <p><a href=""https://geekbarchicago.com/"">Geek Bar Beta</a></p> <p>A geek-culture bar fosters and celebrates geekdom in all its forms. It goes beyond the simple trappings of geek culture like having classic board games or arcade games available to play and embraces the geek culture through events, having geek media on the TVs where other bars might have sports entertainment, guest speakers from within the geek community, having uniforms that reference geek culture, and having staff that is knowledgeable and welcoming to geek culture. As geek culture becomes ever more ascendant in society as a whole as evidenced by top television like Community, Big Bang Theory, and Game of Thrones while movies such as Star Trek, Star Wars, The Avengers, and The Hobbit are topping the movie charts, that geek culture needs a home away from home where they can indulge in being a part of that community while drinking great drinks and fantastic food. At Geek Bar Chicago you can gather with your fellow geeks and share in a unique atmosphere of excitement, curiosity, and community.

The decision could be considered controversial - the project used no external dependencies in production code, and was 100% Java. But there was a back doorâ€_ with Gradle as the build system, there was a tiny excuse to use Groovy in the project, provided it wasnâ€™t in the production code. Thatâ€™s all the excuse we needed to start using Spock for unit and, later, integration tests.</p> <p>Groovy has a lot of advantages as a testing language, and with Spockâ€™s mocking, stubbing, and data driven testing features, it might seem as if this is the perfect way to write tests. In this session, Trisha will cover some of the features that make Spock (and Groovy) compelling for writing tests. But in the interests of fairness, sheâ€™ll also discuss some of the downsides, and the times when Java was chosen instead.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Trisha has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and dabbles with Open Source development. Trisha blogs regularly on subjects that she thinks developers and other humans should care about, sheâ€™s a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group, a key member of the London Java Community and a Java Champion. She believes we shouldn't all have to make the same mistakes again and again, which is why she's now working as a Developer Advocate for JetBrains, where she gets to share all the cool stuff she's learnt with developers all over the world.</p>",1.42798E+12,"Chicago|Orbitz|60661|us|-87.628914|IL|500 W.

A central assumption of the Naive Bayes classifier is the assumption that each predictor, or piece of evidence observed, is independent of other predictors. Given this simplicity (the 'naive' assumption) Naive Bayes classifiers have been shown to outperform other more sophisticated classifiers. We'll review what types of data attributes Rish argues can impact the performance of Naive Bayes as well as review an implementation in Python I wrote.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/reading/papers/Rish.pdf""><a href=""http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/reading/papers/Rish.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/reading/papers/Rish.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/><b>The Speaker:</b><br/>Given that Lorena was a policy analyst what is the likelihood that yes she would want to learn about modeling data?

I hope the session was valuable to you and that you are on your way to learning from customers about the pains and gains associated with the problems they care about most.</p> <p>After the sessions, I was getting the feeling that most of the audience was struggling with this fundamental question.</p> <p><b>How do I get started with my startup?</b></p> <p>The vast majority of the audience were what I affectionately call ""Corporate Wantrapreneurs."" Corporate Wantrapreneurs are working full time at someone else's company, and they are unfulfilled. They see all this startup activity around them, and they are wondering if the grass really is greener on the other side of the fence.</p> <p><i>What if I quit my job and worked full-time on my startup idea?</i></p> <p><i>Am I good enough to make my startup successful?</i></p> <p><i>How much money do I need?</i></p> <p><i>How much time do I need to get to profitability?</i></p> <p><i>Will my partner and loved ones support my crazy idea when it isn't generating income? How much patience will he/she have to indulge my dream?</i></p> <p><i>What if my business fails? Will everyone think I'm loser? Can I get my old job back? Will I beÂ homeless?</i></p> <p><i>Will anyone buy my product?</i></p> <p><i>Is my idea good, or bad and how can I tell?</i></p> <p><i>Is this crazy or is this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I need to pursue?Â </i></p> <p><i>Am IÂ delusional toÂ think this idea will work?</i></p> <p><b>Session 1 of 3: How Do I Get Started With My Startup Idea?</b></p> <p>This meetup is the first in a three part series designed to give you the tools and grit to start your startup with confidence.</p> <p>In this session, I will lead a workshop to help all of you flush out your business idea. This involves defining the business concept in a way that clearly articulates the fundamental business hypotheses behind your idea. At the end of the session, you will have a clear understanding of what your idea is and what you need to do next to determine if it is real, or if it is just a crazy dream.</p> <p>To that end, I propose the following agenda:</p> <p>6:30 pm Networking</p> <p>7:00 pm - 7:30 pm The Building Blocks Of Your Idea</p> <p>- Customer segment hypothesis</p> <p>- Problem hypothesis</p> <p>- Value proposition hypothesis</p> <p>- Business model hypothesis</p> <p>- Riskiest assumption to be tested first</p> <p>7:30 pm - 8:30 pm Working sessionÂ </p> <p>8:30 pm Voluntary Founder presentation</p> <p>9:00 pm Go home and sleep, if you can!</p> <p>Get ready for the next meetup -Â How Do I Develop The Courage Necessary To Start My Own Business?</p> <p>Believe me, I've been there. I understand the thoughts and questions that are running through your mind. I've had all of those thoughts myself before you. In fact, I still have them every time I start something new. Over time, I've learned how to control my fear and anxiety instead of letting my feelings control me. Â </p> <p><br/>Like you, I started my career in Corporate America. I worked in product development at Procter &amp; Gamble, marketing at AT&amp;T and Experian, and general management at Yesmail. I had success in my corporate career, but I didn't fit in. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was really an entrepreneur at heart. It turns out, my path isn't working for someone else. It's blazing my own trail. That's the only time I'm truly happy. Being a serial entrepreneur is my true path.</p> <p>I look around the audience and I see myself in you. 14 years ago, I took my first steps into entrepreneurship. I boldly leaped into the scary, unknown world of living for yourself, most of the time relying on nothing more than your passion and wits. The process has been transformational for me. After I committed fully to my first startup, I knew it was the right path for me.Â And what I difficult, challenging and rewarding path it is!</p> <p>Maybe your experience will be similar. Maybe you just need some encouragement and some confidence. Maybe you just need some guidance, from someone who has been there before you, and has lived through what you are about to do.</p> <p>Or maybe, entrepreneurship isn't a fit for you. Maybe is just a fantasy, born out of frustration from your bullshit job. Maybe you just need a better job, or you need to make your job work for you.</p> <p><i>One of the greatest regrets in life is being what others would want you to be, rather than being yourself.</i></p> <p><br/>I don't know what the answer is for you. Only you can answer this question.</p> <p>All I know is this -- you owe it to yourself to find out. If you haven't found your path yet, you owe it to yourself to keep searching.Â </p> <p><b>FounderSensei can help you discover the truth about your startup idea, and the truth about whether pursuing it is your true path.</b></p> <p>I'd like to host three meetups over the next few weeks where we work together to flush this out. The three sessions are focused on answering these important questions:</p> <p>â€¢ How Do I Get Started With My Startup Idea?</p> <p><br/>â€¢ How Do I Develop The Courage Necessary To Start My Own Business?</p> <p><br/>â€¢ Is My Idea Good Enough To Quit My Job?</p> <p>

Time and time again, that promise has been left unfulfilled because as our data sets have grown, it has become more and more challenging to put that data to use. People continue to struggle to connect the dots between the data theyâ€™ve collected and the meaning that can be extracted. Our current processes assume that trained professionals will analyze data and then articulate the meaning they find. Unfortunately, this approach isnâ€™t sustainable in that people simply cannot scale at the same pace as the explosive growth and proliferation of data. One alternative is to replace the human in this equation with technology. In particular, technology that that can analyze data sets and use the results of that analysis to generate narratives that explain, not the data, but the state of the world that gave rise to it. With Artificial Intelligence, we now have the ability to achieve what we want: human insight at machine scale. The development of systems that can convert data into narratives can provide us with insights and explanations, which will then allow us to make more informed decisions. Kris Hammond will explain why natural language generation is the last mile in Big Data and provide use cases from Narrative Science customers who are using natural language generation in tandem with other business intelligence tools to achieve maximum success for their organizations.</p> <p><br/>Please note: Unfortunately we are unable to refund luncheon fees, as per our contract with the East Bank Club.

<b>Meeting Agenda:Â </b></p> <p>We now have 3 presentations/speakers and time for networking and socializing as well!</p> <p><b>Speakers Topics: </b>Â </p> <p>Here are the topics we will have:</p> <p><b>â€¢Â Using SASÂ® Data Loader for Hadoop, SASÂ® Visual Analytics, and SASÂ® Visual Statistics to Rapidly Prepare and Analyze Big Data</b><b>Â - Mike FrostÂ &amp; Dr. Wayne Thompson</b></p> <p><br/>â€¢Â <b>Using the SASÂ® Output Delivery System (ODS) and the TEMPLATE Procedure to Replace Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) - Peter Timusk</b></p> <p>â€¢Â <b>Navigating the Data Universe aboard the Starship Enterprise GuideSASÂ® Â - Jay Iyengar</b></p> <p>â€¢Â <b>SASÂ® University Edition Â - Zeke Torres</b></p> <p>â€¢Â <b>Beginning Macro Design Issues - Toby Dunn</p> <p></b></p> <p><b>ABSTRACTS ---</b></p> <p><b>Visual Analytics/Visual Statistics - SASÂ® w Hadoop/LASR<br/></b></p> <p>Find the value in your data, no matter the size â€“ including big data stored in Hadoop. A drag-and-drop web browser interface empowers multiple users to explore massive data, then interactively and iteratively create descriptive and predictive models. Distributed, in-memory processing dramatically shortens model development time so you can run complex analytic computations in just minutes. <i>Presented by: Mike Frost</i>Â </p> <p><br/><b>Navigating the Data Universe aboard the Starship Enterprise GuideSASÂ®Â </b></p> <p><br/>Enterprise GuideÂ® is a standalone client application that gives the user access to the power of Base SASÂ®, along with other SASÂ® modules. With Enterprise Guide, one can easily perform the full range of data processing and analysis tasks, from reading, to manipulation, to reporting and graphics. Although EG is oriented towards the analyst with its point and click interface, it includes aspects useful to both the programmer as well as the analyst. This paper gives an overview of each task area, as well as focuses on the pros and cons of using EG. Â <i>Presented by: Jay Iyengar</i></p> <p><br/><b>SASÂ® University EditionÂ </b></p> <p>How I finally got SASÂ® for free on my laptop in just under 5 minutes and I'll show you how even faster. Â <i>Presented by: Zeke Torres</i></p> <p><b>Using the SASÂ® Output Delivery System (ODS) and the TEMPLATE Procedure to Replace Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)</b></p> <p>

Many papers have been written over the years that describe how to use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to pass data from SASÂ® to Excel. This presentation aims to show you how to do the same exchange with the SAS Output Delivery System (ODS) and the TEMPLATE Procedure. <i>Presented by: Peter Timusk</i></p> <p><br/><b>Beginning Macro Design Issues</b></p> <p><br/>Macro!!! Why does this word strike fear into even the most battle hardened SASÂ® programmers? The word macro conjures up visions of complex and convoluted programming which leads to hours of confusing debugging and mind-twisting logical problem solving. Does macro programming have to be this hard? No, it does not. With a little forethought and some careful planning, practically anyone can follow a few simple design principles and turn a complex and seemingly confusing macro problem into a simple, easy-to-follow macro. Although this paper is not a comprehensive discussion of macro design issues, the instructions provided will give the reader a basic foundation on which to start writing clear and concise macros. While programmers of all levels can learn something from this paper, the beginner and intermediate skilled SASÂ® programmers are the intended audience. <i>Presented by: Toby Dunn</i></p> <p>

These systems often have tight responsiveness requirements, too. Meeting such requirements isn't a new problem, but the requirements have grown tighter and more pervasive over time. Even systems with relatively modest requirements can benefit from the techniques used in such systems.</p> <p>The Reactive Manifesto (<a href=""http://reactivemanifesto.org"" class=""linkified"">http://reactivemanifesto.org</a>) was created by several leaders in the fields of distributed systems and high-performance computing to codify several core traits that are universally essential for such Reactive systems. The Manifesto has been refined since it was introduced, in response to feedback from many people.</p> <p>The traits are the following:</p> <p>Responsive: Response times for requests are consistent, satisfying quality of service requirements. Implicit in this trait is the need to recover from errors in a timely manner.</p> <p>Resilient: The system stays responsive in the presence of failure.</p> <p>Elastic: The system stays responsive under various workloads.</p> <p>Message Driven: The system components communicate through messages, which promotes optimal resource utilization (no blocking threads) and decoupling of components for better resiliency.</p> <p>I'll describe how the four traits impact system architectures, without being overly prescriptive.<br/>None of them is new, but many systems that claim to be reactive fall short in one or more of these areas.</p> <p>We'll examine several representative examples to understand how the traits are realized in practice.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Dean Wampler, Ph.D., is the Architect for Big Data Products and Services for Typesafe.

A critical step towards adopting a Service Design mindset is understanding the underlying foundations of the discipline.Â Service-Dominant Logic: What is it and why does it matter? Service-Dominant Logic, formalized by Steve Vargo and Robert Lusch, is founded on a set of principles that change the way that we think about business at large. For example: Instead of thinking about a book, we should think about the service a book can deliver, get it? No? Come to the meetup, even if you do get it, to learn more.</p> <p>This meetup will focus on the historical and practical differences between a Goods-Dominant and a Service-Dominant Logic.

Giddins for his talk titled 'The Limits of Modularity'. More information about the talk, Samuel, and the location can be found below.</p> <p><b>The Limits of Modularity</b></p> <p>I advocate for modular code every day -- I even work on a few dependency managers. But there's a point where modularity becomes too much, where it can strangle your development process and sap your will to code. When your dependencies have dependencies that have dependencies, none of which are ever used elsewhere, chances are you've paralyzed yourself. You've inverted sanity in code organization -- to make any change, you need to modify the bottom-most module, but the tests that might break are in your application. This is a very real situation, and it can spiral out of hand before you realize it. So, how can you avoid this nightmare? Stop abstracting and refactoring for its own sake, and think about where functionality belongs. Down the road, when you need to apply a bug fix, it should be easy to figure out which module requires the fix, and applying it shouldn't break every level up to your application. Modularity is a tool like any other -- it has its limits, but when respected, it can deliver on its promises.</p> <p><br/><b>About Samuel E. Giddins</b></p> <p>Samuel is an iOS developer at Realm, working on building modern and elegant developer tools. As a core team member of CocoaPods, RestKit, and Jazzy, Samuel has spent the past couple of years building open source tools for other developers to enjoy. He will eventually graduate from the University of Chicago, once he decides that being a developer is far too practical.</p> <p><br/><b>Location Info</b></p> <p>When you arrive, enter the Merchandise Mart through the main entrance and go to the elevators between the two security desks. Take the elevators to the 8th floor. These elevators will let you off in Braintreeâ€™s lobby. If you arenâ€™t in Braintreeâ€™s lobby, you took the wrong elevators. Once there, a security guard will check for your name on the RSVP list and check your ID to let you in. Once inside Braintree, there will be signs pointing to where the meetup is taking place.

In this talk, I introduce a new technique for exploring and organizing huge databases using visual features. These visual features aim to characterize the data distributions within a scatterplot (a plot of the values of variable X versus the corresponding values of variable Y).</p> <p>Working directly with these measures, we located unusual correlations between pairs of variables in time series. For large datasets of thousands of dimensions, we use these measures to cluster and display only exemplars (about 30 of them) in a force-directed layout. This provides a comprehensive overview of a high-dimensional dataset. We also apply transformations toÂ reveal hidden patterns that are not apparent in the regular scatterplots. Lastly, we extend this work to handle pixels in images. During the talk, I will demonstrate my applications on real-world data such as detecting events impacting the US unemployment rates over the past 20 years or clustering half million of SETI waterfall plots.</p> <p>About the Speaker</p> <p><img src=""http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/f/3/e/600_435640766.jpeg"" /></p> <p><b>Tuan Nhon Dang </b></p> <p>Tuan Nhon Dang is a Postdoctoral Researcher in information visualization at <a href=""http://www.evl.uic.edu/"">Electronic Visualization Laboratory</a>, <a href=""http://www.cs.uic.edu/"">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href=""http://www.uic.edu/"">University of Illinois at Chicago</a>.

On-premise IT consumption models are shifting to cloud-based services. IT as a service (IaaS) is supplanted by applications as a service. Separate development and operations are moving toward integrated development and operations (DevOps). Box-centric management models are migrating to application-centric management.</p> <p><br/>Business agility requires application agility, so IT teams need to provision applications in hours instead of months. Resources need to scale up (or down) in minutes, not hours.Â Traditional approaches take a siloed operational view, with no common operational model between the application, network, security, and cloud teams. A common operational model delivers application agility, simplified operations, assured performance, and scale.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>The Solution:</b> An Application-Centric Approach to Managing IT Infrastructure</p> <p><b>Why?</b>Â Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) in the data center is a holistic architecture with centralized automation and policy-driven application profiles.
