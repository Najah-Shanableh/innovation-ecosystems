In fact, the Silicon Valley Data Science headquarters are located next to the Bay Area\u2019s commuter line \u2013 a constant and disruptive reminder of our daily frustrations with the train.</p> <p>We put our frustration into action by taking advantage of our location and integrating other publically available sources to create an event detection system that monitors the health of the train network in real-time. In order to gain understanding of a physical system we could only observe in limited ways, we created a variety of data streams including video and audio that detect the sound and image of trains as they pass by.</p> <p>In this informative talk we will give a brief overview of the techniques we used for audio and video detection. We will then describe how we went about combining our physical observations both with each other and with external data sources such as Twitter and public APIs.

We embrace our nerdy identities because they\u2019re an integral part of who we are, and in many cases, have brought us professional success, friendships and happy relationships. What better reason is there to gather than to celebrate being a bunch of big old nerds, sharing our passions and knowledge for the things we love?</p> <p>Who gets to be a nerd (or geek, or dork, etc.)? CNSC believes it\u2019s anyone who wants to be, regardless of ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion or political affiliation. Whether you\u2019re a hardcore fan, a casual gamer or a newbie who can\u2019t tell Klingon from Quenya, all are welcome! We create fun, inclusive, safe spaces that are open to nerds from all walks of life and all levels of fandom \u2013 neither abusive language nor harassment of any kind are tolerated. If following Wheaton\u2019s Law doesn\u2019t appeal to you, as a wise old Jedi once said, \u201cThese aren\u2019t the droids you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p> <p>The Chicago Nerd Social Club hosts a number of nerd-friendly events. Some are purely social: casual get-togethers at a bar, trips to the movies, gaming nights. Others are informational in nature: local museum outings, introductions to new technologies, and comic book swap nights. Most events are free or as inexpensive as we can make them. So join us at our next event!</p> <p><a href=\"https://geekbarchicago.com/\">Geek Bar Beta</a></p> <p>A geek-culture bar fosters and celebrates geekdom in all its forms. It goes beyond the simple trappings of geek culture like having classic board games or arcade games available to play and embraces the geek culture through events, having geek media on the TVs where other bars might have sports entertainment, guest speakers from within the geek community, having uniforms that reference geek culture, and having staff that is knowledgeable and welcoming to geek culture. As geek culture becomes ever more ascendant in society as a whole as evidenced by top television like Community, Big Bang Theory, and Game of Thrones while movies such as Star Trek, Star Wars, The Avengers, and The Hobbit are topping the movie charts, that geek culture needs a home away from home where they can indulge in being a part of that community while drinking great drinks and fantastic food. At Geek Bar Chicago you can gather with your fellow geeks and share in a unique atmosphere of excitement, curiosity, and community.

The decision could be considered controversial - the project used no external dependencies in production code, and was 100% Java. But there was a back door\u2026 with Gradle as the build system, there was a tiny excuse to use Groovy in the project, provided it wasn\u2019t in the production code. That\u2019s all the excuse we needed to start using Spock for unit and, later, integration tests.</p> <p>Groovy has a lot of advantages as a testing language, and with Spock\u2019s mocking, stubbing, and data driven testing features, it might seem as if this is the perfect way to write tests. In this session, Trisha will cover some of the features that make Spock (and Groovy) compelling for writing tests. But in the interests of fairness, she\u2019ll also discuss some of the downsides, and the times when Java was chosen instead.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Trisha has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and dabbles with Open Source development. Trisha blogs regularly on subjects that she thinks developers and other humans should care about, she\u2019s a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group, a key member of the London Java Community and a Java Champion. She believes we shouldn't all have to make the same mistakes again and again, which is why she's now working as a Developer Advocate for JetBrains, where she gets to share all the cool stuff she's learnt with developers all over the world.</p>", "created": 1427984004000, "rsvp_limit": 160, "venue": {"city": "Chicago", "name": "Orbitz", "zip": "60661", "country": "us", "lon": -87.628914, "state": "IL", "address_1": "500 W.

A central assumption of the Naive Bayes classifier is the assumption that each predictor, or piece of evidence observed, is independent of other predictors. Given this simplicity (the 'naive' assumption) Naive Bayes classifiers have been shown to outperform other more sophisticated classifiers.

This involves defining the business concept in a way that clearly articulates the fundamental business hypotheses behind your idea. At the end of the session, you will have a clear understanding of what your idea is and what you need to do next to determine if it is real, or if it is just a crazy dream.</p> <p>To that end, I propose the following agenda:</p> <p>6:30 pm Networking</p> <p>7:00 pm - 7:30 pm The Building Blocks Of Your Idea</p> <p>- Customer segment hypothesis</p> <p>- Problem hypothesis</p> <p>- Value proposition hypothesis</p> <p>- Business model hypothesis</p> <p>- Riskiest assumption to be tested first</p> <p>7:30 pm - 8:30 pm Working session\u00a0</p> <p>8:30 pm Voluntary Founder presentation</p> <p>9:00 pm Go home and sleep, if you can!</p> <p>Get ready for the next meetup -\u00a0How Do I Develop The Courage Necessary To Start My Own Business?</p> <p>Believe me, I've been there. I understand the thoughts and questions that are running through your mind. I've had all of those thoughts myself before you. In fact, I still have them every time I start something new. Over time, I've learned how to control my fear and anxiety instead of letting my feelings control me. \u00a0</p> <p><br/>Like you, I started my career in Corporate America. I worked in product development at Procter &amp; Gamble, marketing at AT&amp;T and Experian, and general management at Yesmail. I had success in my corporate career, but I didn't fit in. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was really an entrepreneur at heart. It turns out, my path isn't working for someone else. It's blazing my own trail. That's the only time I'm truly happy. Being a serial entrepreneur is my true path.</p> <p>I look around the audience and I see myself in you. 14 years ago, I took my first steps into entrepreneurship. I boldly leaped into the scary, unknown world of living for yourself, most of the time relying on nothing more than your passion and wits. The process has been transformational for me. After I committed fully to my first startup, I knew it was the right path for me.\u00a0And what I difficult, challenging and rewarding path it is!</p> <p>Maybe your experience will be similar. Maybe you just need some encouragement and some confidence. Maybe you just need some guidance, from someone who has been there before you, and has lived through what you are about to do.</p> <p>Or maybe, entrepreneurship isn't a fit for you. Maybe is just a fantasy, born out of frustration from your bullshit job. Maybe you just need a better job, or you need to make your job work for you.</p> <p><i>One of the greatest regrets in life is being what others would want you to be, rather than being yourself.</i></p> <p><br/>I don't know what the answer is for you. Only you can answer this question.</p> <p>All I know is this -- you owe it to yourself to find out. If you haven't found your path yet, you owe it to yourself to keep searching.\u00a0</p> <p><b>FounderSensei can help you discover the truth about your startup idea, and the truth about whether pursuing it is your true path.</b></p> <p>I'd like to host three meetups over the next few weeks where we work together to flush this out. The three sessions are focused on answering these important questions:</p> <p>\u2022 How Do I Get Started With My Startup Idea?</p> <p><br/>\u2022 How Do I Develop The Courage Necessary To Start My Own Business?</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Is My Idea Good Enough To Quit My Job?</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About <a href=\"http://foundersensei.com\">FounderSensei</a></b></p> <p>FounderSensei is for entrepreneurs who want to master the craft of creating a successful businesses from scratch.

Kingsbury<br/>Chicago, IL 60610</p> <p>Using AI to make sense of the Numbers : Generating Meaningful Narratives from Big Data.</p> <p>The promise of Big Data was access to information that can be used to make better decisions to improve our lives and businesses. Time and time again, that promise has been left unfulfilled because as our data sets have grown, it has become more and more challenging to put that data to use. People continue to struggle to connect the dots between the data they\u2019ve collected and the meaning that can be extracted. Our current processes assume that trained professionals will analyze data and then articulate the meaning they find. Unfortunately, this approach isn\u2019t sustainable in that people simply cannot scale at the same pace as the explosive growth and proliferation of data. One alternative is to replace the human in this equation with technology. In particular, technology that that can analyze data sets and use the results of that analysis to generate narratives that explain, not the data, but the state of the world that gave rise to it. With Artificial Intelligence, we now have the ability to achieve what we want: human insight at machine scale. The development of systems that can convert data into narratives can provide us with insights and explanations, which will then allow us to make more informed decisions. Kris Hammond will explain why natural language generation is the last mile in Big Data and provide use cases from Narrative Science customers who are using natural language generation in tandem with other business intelligence tools to achieve maximum success for their organizations.</p> <p><br/>Please note: Unfortunately we are unable to refund luncheon fees, as per our contract with the East Bank Club.

A drag-and-drop web browser interface empowers multiple users to explore massive data, then interactively and iteratively create descriptive and predictive models. Distributed, in-memory processing dramatically shortens model development time so you can run complex analytic computations in just minutes. <i>Presented by: Mike Frost</i>\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Navigating the Data Universe aboard the Starship Enterprise GuideSAS\u00ae\u00a0</b></p> <p><br/>Enterprise Guide\u00ae is a standalone client application that gives the user access to the power of Base SAS\u00ae, along with other SAS\u00ae modules. With Enterprise Guide, one can easily perform the full range of data processing and analysis tasks, from reading, to manipulation, to reporting and graphics. Although EG is oriented towards the analyst with its point and click interface, it includes aspects useful to both the programmer as well as the analyst. This paper gives an overview of each task area, as well as focuses on the pros and cons of using EG. \u00a0<i>Presented by: Jay Iyengar</i></p> <p><br/><b>SAS\u00ae University Edition\u00a0</b></p> <p>How I finally got SAS\u00ae for free on my laptop in just under 5 minutes and I'll show you how even faster. \u00a0<i>Presented by: Zeke Torres</i></p> <p><b>Using the SAS\u00ae Output Delivery System (ODS) and the TEMPLATE Procedure to Replace Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)</b></p> <p>\n\nMany papers have been written over the years that describe how to use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to pass data from SAS\u00ae to Excel. This presentation aims to show you how to do the same exchange with the SAS Output Delivery System (ODS) and the TEMPLATE Procedure. <i>Presented by: Peter Timusk</i></p> <p><br/><b>Beginning Macro Design Issues</b></p> <p><br/>Macro!!! Why does this word strike fear into even the most battle hardened SAS\u00ae programmers? The word macro conjures up visions of complex and convoluted programming which leads to hours of confusing debugging and mind-twisting logical problem solving. Does macro programming have to be this hard? No, it does not. With a little forethought and some careful planning, practically anyone can follow a few simple design principles and turn a complex and seemingly confusing macro problem into a simple, easy-to-follow macro. Although this paper is not a comprehensive discussion of macro design issues, the instructions provided will give the reader a basic foundation on which to start writing clear and concise macros. While programmers of all levels can learn something from this paper, the beginner and intermediate skilled SAS\u00ae programmers are the intended audience. <i>Presented by: Toby Dunn</i></p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>More Details Coming Soon!<br/></b></p> <p><b>Location:</b></p> <p>Our meeting location will be\u00a0200 W Jackson Chicago Illinois - When you RSVP you will get the details.</p> <p><b>REQUIRED:</b>\u00a0</p> <p><i><b>You must RSVP</b></i> at least 48 hours in advance to be allowed thru the receptionist/security desk that night.</p> <p><b>COST:</b></p> <p>Free</p> <p><b>Refreshments/Pizza:</b>\u00a0</p> <p>Provided</p>", "created": 1428935673000, "venue": {"city": "Chicago", "name": "Enova", "zip": "60606", "country": "us", "lon": -87.634102, "state": "IL", "address_1": "200 West Jackson", "address_2": "13th floor conference center", "repinned": false, "lat": 41.878419, "id": 1075638}, "updated": 1432092826000, "visibility": "public", "id": "221811696", "yes_rsvp_count": 39, "time": 1432071000000, "duration": 10800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "how_to_find_us": "Enova - 200 West Jackson - you Must RSVP", "group": {"who": "Coders", "name": "Chicago SAS\u00ae Meetup", "group_lat": 41.88999938964844, "created": 1412121136000, "join_mode": "open", "group_lon": -87.62999725341797, "urlname": "Chicago-SAS-Meetup", "id": 17323292}, "name": "SAS presentations - Speakers - Learning Event - @Enova"}, {"status": "past", "distance": 0.9810643196105957, "utc_offset": -18000000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Computational-Tools-in-Precision-Medicine-Chicago-Meetup/events/221867384/", "rating": {"count": 3, "average": 5}, "description": "<p>As for the Agenda of our first meeting, we will start with a short intro of our goals and plans for 2015,\u00a0followed by a presentation on \"Introduction to Precision Medicine - a Computational perspective.

These systems often have tight responsiveness requirements, too. Meeting such requirements isn't a new problem, but the requirements have grown tighter and more pervasive over time. Even systems with relatively modest requirements can benefit from the techniques used in such systems.</p> <p>The Reactive Manifesto (<a href=\"http://reactivemanifesto.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://reactivemanifesto.org</a>) was created by several leaders in the fields of distributed systems and high-performance computing to codify several core traits that are universally essential for such Reactive systems. The Manifesto has been refined since it was introduced, in response to feedback from many people.</p> <p>The traits are the following:</p> <p>Responsive: Response times for requests are consistent, satisfying quality of service requirements. Implicit in this trait is the need to recover from errors in a timely manner.</p> <p>Resilient: The system stays responsive in the presence of failure.</p> <p>Elastic: The system stays responsive under various workloads.</p> <p>Message Driven: The system components communicate through messages, which promotes optimal resource utilization (no blocking threads) and decoupling of components for better resiliency.</p> <p>I'll describe how the four traits impact system architectures, without being overly prescriptive.<br/>None of them is new, but many systems that claim to be reactive fall short in one or more of these areas.</p> <p>We'll examine several representative examples to understand how the traits are realized in practice.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Dean Wampler, Ph.D., is the Architect for Big Data Products and Services for Typesafe.

Giddins for his talk titled 'The Limits of Modularity'. More information about the talk, Samuel, and the location can be found below.</p> <p><b>The Limits of Modularity</b></p> <p>I advocate for modular code every day -- I even work on a few dependency managers. But there's a point where modularity becomes too much, where it can strangle your development process and sap your will to code. When your dependencies have dependencies that have dependencies, none of which are ever used elsewhere, chances are you've paralyzed yourself. You've inverted sanity in code organization -- to make any change, you need to modify the bottom-most module, but the tests that might break are in your application. This is a very real situation, and it can spiral out of hand before you realize it. So, how can you avoid this nightmare? Stop abstracting and refactoring for its own sake, and think about where functionality belongs. Down the road, when you need to apply a bug fix, it should be easy to figure out which module requires the fix, and applying it shouldn't break every level up to your application. Modularity is a tool like any other -- it has its limits, but when respected, it can deliver on its promises.</p> <p><br/><b>About Samuel E. Giddins</b></p> <p>Samuel is an iOS developer at Realm, working on building modern and elegant developer tools. As a core team member of CocoaPods, RestKit, and Jazzy, Samuel has spent the past couple of years building open source tools for other developers to enjoy. He will eventually graduate from the University of Chicago, once he decides that being a developer is far too practical.</p> <p><br/><b>Location Info</b></p> <p>When you arrive, enter the Merchandise Mart through the main entrance and go to the elevators between the two security desks.

For large datasets of thousands of dimensions, we use these measures to cluster and display only exemplars (about 30 of them) in a force-directed layout. This provides a comprehensive overview of a high-dimensional dataset. We also apply transformations to\u00a0reveal hidden patterns that are not apparent in the regular scatterplots. Lastly, we extend this work to handle pixels in images. During the talk, I will demonstrate my applications on real-world data such as detecting events impacting the US unemployment rates over the past 20 years or clustering half million of SETI waterfall plots.</p> <p>About the Speaker</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/f/3/e/600_435640766.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Tuan Nhon Dang </b></p> <p>Tuan Nhon Dang is a Postdoctoral Researcher in information visualization at <a href=\"http://www.evl.uic.edu/\">Electronic Visualization Laboratory</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cs.uic.edu/\">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uic.edu/\">University of Illinois at Chicago</a>.

(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/wcl101\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/wcl101</a>). This Workshop is offered every couple of months and runs from 9 am - 5 pm. Our next one is June 20.</p> <p>The 6 Workshops are a combination of lecture and hands on circuit building and programming. Our motto is, and always has been, \u201clearning by doing\u201d.\u00a0</p> <p>Technical requirements for the 6 Workshops include: \u00a0 A laptop, an Arduino Uno with a wireless breadboard, breadboard wires and USB cable. If you need a Arduino starter kit, one can be purchased when you enroll in one of the 6 Workshop via Eventbrite. \u00a0We will have them for you when you arrive.\u00a0 Note, it is best to have this BEFORE coming to the workshop to ensure you have all the software and drivers loaded properly.</p> <p>As an additional benefit, each of the 6 Workshops will include additional hardware to use to demonstrate the concepts being taught and is yours to keep after the Workshop.\u00a0</p> <p>Workshop Dates and Topics Follow:</p> <p>May 20:\u00a0 I2C/TWI Communication - In Depth</p> <p><br/>June 3: Interrupt Handling\u00a0</p> <p>June 19: SPI Communication</p> <p>July 3:\u00a0 Working with Timers &amp; the Watchdog Timer</p> <p>July 17: Memory Management</p> <p>August 19: Sleep modes, Fuses, Power Management</p> <p>Note:\u00a0 This is not like a standard Meet-up that has beer &amp; pizza and networking time.\u00a0 Please eat dinner before you arrive and arrive early enough that you have time to get yourself setup with your laptop and board.</p> <p>We will start promptly at 6:30pm and finish promptly at 8:30pm.</p>", "created": 1430161785000, "rsvp_limit": 40, "venue": {"city": "Chicago", "name": "Windy City Lab @ 1871", "country": "us", "lon": -87.635361, "state": "IL", "address_1": "222 W.
